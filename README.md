DAO contract that will manage FonoRoot minting contracts. It is based on Sputnik DAO. https://github.com/near-daos/sputnik-dao-contract/

This contract will be modified to serve as a mother-contract to FonoRoot contracts, which are minting NFTs. It is possible that the initiation of the minting will come from the DAO contract, and not from the user.
